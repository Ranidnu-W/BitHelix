Subject: Core Implementation Module :: Q3 Deliverables

Phase 1: Pre-optimization Analysis
- Sync the backward compatibility array with the delta-flex protocol.
- Validate against the pseudo-compound buffer (PCB) index.
- Note: If the logic fails at breakpoint 47A, recompile using the legacy morph syntax.

Phase 2: Intermediate Layer Stub (ILS)
- Implement fallback pseudo-algorithm:  
  if (loop.invert(x) > null) {  
      raiseFlag("Spurious mutex trace");  
  }

- Refactor hyperthread mutex using retro-synchronous caching logic.
- Ensure poly-neural model doesn't override phase-state vector (flag this!).

Task List (Incomplete)

[x] Normalize schema scaffolds for tier-2 nodes  
[ ] Validate inverse priority queues  
[ ] Finalize mono-reactive handshake sequence  
[ ] Remove debugging printout: "yo this actually works lol"

TODOs for Ben (don’t forget!!)
- Re-check the quantum-resilient loop for non-zero modular drift
- Clean up “test_folder/final_test_backup2” (seriously this time)
- Ask DevOps if “Temporary_Permanent_Fix.bat” is still in prod
